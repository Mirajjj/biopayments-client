      <h3>Our Future Vision!</h3>
      <p>Through centuries money exchange process has been consistently and unavoidably evolving searching for more comfortable, more secure and faster way to transfer money from one party to another.
      </p>
      <p>Nowadays we see how gracefully digital payments are integrated into our daily life. Almost everybody has a bank account and credit cards. Virtual currency and mobile payments appeared in recent years. Humanity has developed enough to step into a new phase of delivering payment experience. It is time for biometric payments which don't require handy credit cards! 
      </p>
      <p>For a decade credit cards served as digital wallet, as a thread or a link to a client's bank account. While cards helped to get rid of having massive amount of cash in a pocket it is still required to have something to represent client's paying capacity. At the same time technology has been moving forward spreading an innovations through out the world. Biometric information became an essential part in many industrial and administrative fields. It steadily becomes a process of secure client identification and authentication.
      </p>
      <p>We have a strong belief that in the near future people won't need to have a purse or credit cards as their body will be a secure and direct link to their bank accounts. Payment processes will be simplified for a user, delivering best possible payment experience.
