    <p>We strongly believe that a key to a successful business lies in proper aproach to partnership. We aim to build profitable relations with companies that meet certain requirements. For us it is critically important that these relations were profitable for both parties to create long lasting partnership.</p>

    <p>We are strong supporters of biometric innovations. It our conviction that we are on the edge when biometric technology is widespread and easy accessible. Thus, it is only a matter of time when people start doing usual things for them but only using their biometric data as it is much easier! We look for partners that will support us in these ideas, and will help to spread the technology.</p>
